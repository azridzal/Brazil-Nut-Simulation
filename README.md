# Brazil-Nut-Simulation
Hi there! This is my first project I did in school where I coded from scratch. 
It is a simulation of the Brazil Nut effect. 
It's an interesting phenomenon found in a can of nuts. When opened, the large Brazil Nuts are commonly found at the top. Thus giving this it's name. 

I used many different resources in order to accurately descriobe the effect in code. 
The projecy in its entirety can be found in the Projeect_Final.ipnyb file. 
Thank you! :)
