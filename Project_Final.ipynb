    "Granular materials exhibit an array of complex behaviours that defy simple classifications such as solid, liquid or gas. One particularly interesting phenomena is the Brazil Nut effect. In a container of a granulated medium, vibrating, agitating or shaking the container will result in spontaneous segregation of sizes. Counterintuitively, larger granules tend to rise to the surface as a result of a combination of granular convection and size-dependent percolation (Hong et al., 2001; Moss et al., 2023)."

    "When the granular medium is shaken, it creates a circular pattern similar to convection in fluids, causing the particles at the bottom to rise to the top and vice versa in a cyclical pattern (Moss et al., 2023). Multiple studies also show that an important factor that contributes to the effect is the existance of friction along the walls (Knight et al., 1993 and Maurel et al., 2017). The gaps within the medium are also disrupted, creating space under the larger particles for smaller particles to fall into and fill up, thereby pushing the larger particles upward and keeping them at the surface (Hong et al., 2001). It is also interesting to note that the reverse <em>Brazil Nut effect</em> does occur in specific conditions (Knight et al. 1993)."

    "The understanding of the effect is considerably important in many fields ranging from geophysics and pharmaceuticals to materials handling. For example, in pharmaceuticals, size segregation would help to filter the smaller granules which would increase tensile strenth of tablets (Herting et al., 2001). Or in Geology, soil and sand layers can seperate due to the vibrations caused by earthquakes. Studying granular flows can help predict how the granular layers behave to prevent crisis (Taslimian, 2024). It exemplifies how non-equilibrium dynamics and local interactions in granular interactions can give rise to emergent macroscopic order."

    "The simulation adopts a time-step driven approach, in which the entire duration of the systems evolution is discretised into small increments where the dynamics are computed iteratively at each step. A time-tep formulation is more appropriate than an event driven simulation due to its \"dense\" nature amd sustained contact interactions when particles settle. The collision times of the particles tend to approach a limit $t\\to0$. In this regime, an event driven algorithm, which relies on resolving discrete collisions become inapplicable (Thornton, 2015, p.2). The time-step method therefore provides a better framework for capturing the dynamics of this system."

    "Note that the same initail conditions were applied for all runs in this experiment, the large particle starts at the bottom of the pile near the centre of the box. The simulation was programmed to run for 10000 steps to ensure sufficient evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results seem to indicate a minimal magnitude of vibration required for the effect to take place, which seem to be in the 100-125 range. Below this threshold, the large particle stays at the base of the pile and does not move up. This suggests that the energy of the kick was insufficient to bump the larger particle up in order for the smaller particles to fill in the cavity beneath, which is crucial in the occurence of the <em>Brazil Nut Effect</em>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Futhermore, The vertical displacement of the large particle also tops out at a position of $y\\approx7$ which suggests that it is the height of the bed of small particles. This would imply that increasing the vibration magnitude would not yield a higher vertical position."

    "The results suggest that the range of values that meaningfully contribute to the difference in vertical displacement of the large particle at the end of the simulation would lie between $\\approx 100 \\to 200$. Interestingly, the case that corresponds to vibration magnitude$=175$ seem to be an outlier. Upon closer inspection of the animation, it was noticed that the large particle seems to get trapped if it is near to the sides preventing the upward migration. Another interesting note is that for the effects to occur consistently and reliably, the system has to settle after every kick. Without time for the bed to settle, the particles would not evenly distribute the upward force to the large particle needed for the effect to take place."

    "While the system is succesful at recreating the key aspects of the <em>Brazil Nut Effect</em>, several limitations need to be addressed. First, the system is represented on a 2-dimensional plane. This simplifies interactions and might not capture fully the comploexity of 3-dimensional granular dynamics. Secondly, the choice of arbitrary constants such as the frictional constant, damoing constant and gravity was not calibrated to experimental data which would not accurately reflect the physical interactions in reality. Thirdly, the simulation assumes the granules are perfect spheres which is rarely the case in real life. This also does not accurately reflect granular dynamics in reality. Finally, computational constraint required the simulation to use a finite number of steps and particles which could restrict the observation or resolution of the interactions occuring. \n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations suggest that further refinement is required to provide more qualitative insights into the <em>Brazil Nut Effect</em>."

    "The simulation managed to capture the dynamics of the phenomenon and recreated the <em>Brazil NutEffect</em> with somewhat accurate physics. By applying a controlled vertical vibration, the simulation was successfull at recreating the granular convection, even highlighting the threshold magnitude of vibration for the phenomenon to occur. Observations also revealed the importance of the settling of the system and the role that the boundaries play in influencing the effect. Although the model is simple, it highlights the effects of local interactions on macroscopic phenomena.  "
